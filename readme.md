# Purpose #
The purpose of this repository is to inform those who wish to write multiple interrupt routines when there is only one vector available, but multiple sources available for that vector.

Simply drop these files into your new MSP430 CCS project! I used the MSP430F2231 for debugging, but the instructions should apply to all MSP430-series devices.
